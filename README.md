# UniversityMentalHealth_Identifier

Mental health has always been an issue that I was interested in and after seeing the dataset from the research of Nguyen et al (2019), where the authors obtained a record of 268 questionaire results of depression, acculturative stress, social connectedness, and help-seeking behaviour by a cohort of local and international students, I decided to see if I could use this dataset to see if I could identify at risk students and reach out to them sooner. I performed my analysis with the help of UpLevelSG.

More details of the dataset can be found here: https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/4/3/124/htm
